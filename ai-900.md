# ML and AI Concepts
## Layers of Machine Learning
### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Machines that perform jobs that **mimic human behaviour**.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machines that get better at a task **without explicit programming**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Machines that have an **artificial neural network** inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

### What is a Data Scientist?
A person with **multi-disciplinary skills** in math, statistics, predictive modeling, and machine learning **to make future predictions**.

## Key Elements of AI
AI is just the outcome. AI is the software that **imitates human behaviour and capabilities**.

Key elements:
- **Machine learning:** the foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
- **Anomaly detection:** detect outliers or things out of place like a human
- **Computer vision:** be able to see like a human
- **Natural language processing:** be able to process human languages and infer context
- **Conversational AI:** be able to hold a conversation with a human

## Data Sets
### What is a dataset?
A data set is a **logical grouping of units of data** that are closely related and/or share the same data structure.

There are **publicly available data** sets that are used in the **learning of statistics, data analytics, and machine learning**.

- **MNITS database:** Images of **handwritten digits** used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithm. 
- **Common Objects In Context (COCO) dataset:** A dataset which contains many common images using a JSON file (coco format) that identify objects or segments within an image. 

## Labeling
### What is Data Labeling?
The process of **identifying raw data** (images, text file, videos, etc.) **and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels** to **provide context** so that a machine learning model can learn.

With **supervised machine learning**, labeling is a prerequisite to produce training data and **each piece of data will generally be labeled by a human**.

With **unsupervised machine learning**, **labels will be produced by the machine**, and may not be human readable.

### What is a ground truth?
A properly labeled dataset that you can use as the objective standard to train and assess a given model is often called "ground truth". The accuracy of your trained model will depend on the accuracy of your ground truth.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement
**Supervised Learning (SL):** Data has been labeled for training. It is task-driven - **make a prediction**.
- When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome.
- When you need a specific value returned.
- e.g. **Classification**, **Regression**

**Unsuperfised Learning (UL)**: Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling. It is data-driven - **recognize a structure or parttern**.
- When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise.
- When you're trying to make sense of data.
- e.g. **Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction**, **Association**

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data and makes many attempts to reach a goal. It is decisions-driven - **Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation**

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Activation Functions** are algorithms applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output. e.g. ReLu

**Dense** is when the next layer _increases_ the amount of nodes.

**Sparse** is when the next layer _decreases_ the amount of nodes.

### What are Neural Networks (NN)?
Often described as **mimicking the brain**, it is a **neuron/node represents an algorithm.**

Data is inputted into a neuron and based on the output the data will be passed to one of many other connected neurals. The connections between neurons is **weighted**. The network is organized in layers.
There will be an **input layer**, 1 to many **hidden layers** and an **output layer**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
A neural network that has **3 or more hidden layers** is considered deep learning.

### What is Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)?
Neural Networks where connections between nodes do not form a cycle (always move forward)

### What is Backpropagation (BP)?
Moves backwards through the neural network adjusting weights to improve outcome on next iteration. This is how a neural network learns.

### Loss Function
A function that compares the _ground truth_ to the prediction to determine the error rate (how bad the network performed)

## Graphics processing unit (GPU)
### What is a GPU?
Designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video **concurrently**. It can perform **parallel operations on multiple sets of data**, 
and so they are commonly used for **non-graphical tasks such as machine learning** and scientific computation.

CPU can average 4 to 16 processor cores while a GPU can average **thousands of processor cores**. They are best suited for **repetetive** and **highly-parallel** computing tasks
such as _rendering graphics_, _Cryptocurrency mining_, and _Deep Learning and ML_.

## Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
### What is NVIDIA?
It is a company that manufactures **GPUs** for gaming and professional markets.

### What is CUDA?
Compute Unified Device Architecture is a **parallel computing platform** and **API** by NVIDIA that allows developers to use **CUDA-enabled GPUs** for general-purpose computing on GPUs.

All major deep learning frameworks are integrated with **NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK**. It is a collection of NVIDIA libraries for deep learning.
One of those libraries is the **CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN)**. It provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as:
- forward and backward convolution
- Pooling
- Normalization
- activation layers
