# ML and AI Concepts
## Layers of Machine Learning
### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Machines that perform jobs that **mimic human behaviour**.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machines that get better at a task **without explicit programming**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Machines that have an **artificial neural network** inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

### What is a Data Scientist?
A person with **multi-disciplinary skills** in math, statistics, predictive modeling, and machine learning **to make future predictions**.

## Key Elements of AI
AI is just the outcome. AI is the software that **imitates human behaviour and capabilities**.

Key elements:
- **Machine learning:** the foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
- **Anomaly detection:** detect outliers or things out of place like a human
- **Computer vision:** be able to see like a human
- **Natural language processing:** be able to process human languages and infer context
- **Conversational AI:** be able to hold a conversation with a human

## Data Sets
### What is a dataset?
A data set is a **logical grouping of units of data** that are closely related and/or share the same data structure.

There are **publicly available data** sets that are used in the **learning of statistics, data analytics, and machine learning**.

- **MNITS database:** Images of **handwritten digits** used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithm. 
- **Common Objects In Context (COCO) dataset:** A dataset which contains many common images using a JSON file (coco format) that identify objects or segments within an image. 

## Labeling
### What is Data Labeling?
The process of **identifying raw data** (images, text file, videos, etc.) **and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels** to **provide context** so that a machine learning model can learn.

With **supervised machine learning**, labeling is a prerequisite to produce training data and **each piece of data will generally be labeled by a human**.

With **unsupervised machine learning**, **labels will be produced by the machine**, and may not be human readable.

### What is a ground truth?
A properly labeled dataset that you can use as the objective standard to train and assess a given model is often called "ground truth". The accuracy of your trained model will depend on the accuracy of your ground truth.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement
**Supervised Learning (SL):** Data has been labeled for training. It is task-driven - **make a prediction**.
- When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome.
- When you need a specific value returned.
- e.g. **Classification**, **Regression**

**Unsuperfised Learning (UL)**: Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling. It is data-driven - **recognize a structure or parttern**.
- When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise.
- When you're trying to make sense of data.
- e.g. **Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction**, **Association**

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data and makes many attempts to reach a goal. It is decisions-driven - **Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation**

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Activation Functions** are algorithms applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output. e.g. ReLu

**Dense** is when the next layer _increases_ the amount of nodes.

**Sparse** is when the next layer _decreases_ the amount of nodes.

### What are Neural Networks (NN)?
Often described as **mimicking the brain**, it is a **neuron/node represents an algorithm.**

Data is inputted into a neuron and based on the output the data will be passed to one of many other connected neurals. The connections between neurons is **weighted**. The network is organized in layers.
There will be an **input layer**, 1 to many **hidden layers** and an **output layer**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
A neural network that has **3 or more hidden layers** is considered deep learning.

### What is Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)?
Neural Networks where connections between nodes do not form a cycle (always move forward)

### What is Backpropagation (BP)?
Moves backwards through the neural network adjusting weights to improve outcome on next iteration. This is how a neural network learns.

### Loss Function
A function that compares the _ground truth_ to the prediction to determine the error rate (how bad the network performed)

## Graphics processing unit (GPU)
### What is a GPU?
Designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video **concurrently**. It can perform **parallel operations on multiple sets of data**, 
and so they are commonly used for **non-graphical tasks such as machine learning** and scientific computation.

CPU can average 4 to 16 processor cores while a GPU can average **thousands of processor cores**. They are best suited for **repetetive** and **highly-parallel** computing tasks
such as _rendering graphics_, _Cryptocurrency mining_, and _Deep Learning and ML_.

## Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
### What is NVIDIA?
**NVIDIA** is a company that manufactures **GPUs** for gaming and professional markets.

### What is CUDA?
Compute Unified Device Architecture is a **parallel computing platform** and **API** by NVIDIA that allows developers to use **CUDA-enabled GPUs** for general-purpose computing on GPUs.

All major deep learning frameworks are integrated with **NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK**. It is a collection of NVIDIA libraries for deep learning.
One of those libraries is the **CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN)**. It provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as:
- forward and backward convolution
- Pooling
- Normalization
- activation layers

## Simple ML Pipeline
Data Labeling → Feature Engineering → Training → Hyperparameter Tuning → Serving → Inference (either Real-time Endpoint or Batch Processing)

## Forecast vs Prediction
### What is a Forecast?
Makes a future prediction with **relevant data**.
- Analysis of trends
- It's not "guessing"

### What is a Prediction?
Makes a future prediction **without relevant data**.
- Uses statistics to predict future outcomes
- It's more of "guessing
- Uses decision theory

## Evaluation Metrics
### Performance/Evaluation Metrics
Used to evaluate different Machine Learning Algorithms. For different types of problems different metrics matter.
- Classification Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC)
- Regression Metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE)
- Ranking Metrics (MRR, DCG, NDCG)
- Statistical Metrics (Correlation)
- Computer Vision Metrics (PSNR, SSIM, IoU)
- NLP Metrics (Perplexity, BLEU, METEOR, ROGUE)
- Deep Learning Related Metrics (Inception Score, Frechet Inception distance)

There are two categories of evaluation metrics
- **Internal Evaluation:** metrics used to evaluate the internals of the ML model
  - Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall (The Famous Four) used in all kinds of model
- **External Evaluation:** metrics used to evaluate the final prediction of the ML model

## Jupyter Notebooks
A Web-based application for authoring documents that combine:
- Live-code
- Narrative text

- Visualizations

**JupyterLab** is a **next-generation web-based user interface**. It has:
- Notebook
- Terminal
- Text editor
- File browser
- Rich outputs

JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook.

## Regression (Supervised)
**Regression** is a process of finding a function to **correlate a labeled dataset into continous variable/number**. Outcome: Predict this _variable_ in the future.

"What will the temperature be next week?" e.g. 20c

Vector (dots) are plotted on a graph in multiple dimensions e.g. (X, Y). A regression line is drawn through the dataset. The _distance_ of the vector from the regression line is called an _Error_.

Different **Regression algorithms** use the error to predict future variables:
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Mean absolute error (MAE)

## Classification (Supervised)
**Classification** is a process of finding a function to **divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories**. Outcome: Predict _category_ to apply to the inputted data.

"Will it rain next Saturday?" e.g. Sunny, Rainy

A _classification line_ divides the dataset. **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree/Random Forest**, **Neural Network**, **Naive Bayes**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Support Vector Machines** are examples of _classification algorithms_.

## Clustering (Unsupervised)
**Clustering** is a process of **grouping unlabeled data based on similarities and differences**. Outcome: Group data based on similarities or differences. 

Recommend purchasing between a _Windows_ or a _MAC_ computer.

**K-means**, **K-medoids**, **Density Based**, and **Heirarchical** are examples of _clustering algorithms_.

## Confusion Matrix
**Confusion matrix** is a table to visualize the **model predictions** (predicted) vs **ground truth labels** (actual). It is also known as error matrix.
They are useful in classification problems.

Confusion Matrix creates a table that answers how many were **False Negatives**, **False Positives**, **True Negatives**, and **True Positives**.

## Anomaly Detection AI
### What is an anomaly?
An abnormal thing; a marked deviation from the norm or a standard.

### What is anomaly detection?
**Anomaly detection** is the process of finding outliers within a dataset called an **anomaly**. Detecting when a piece of data or access patterns appear suspicious or malicious.

Use cases for anomaly detection:
- Data cleaning
- **Intrusion detection**
- **Fraud detection**
- Systems health monitoring
- Event detection in sensor networks
- Ecosystem disturbances
- Detection of critical and cascading flaws

Anomaly detection by hand is a very tedious process. Using machine learning for anomaly detection is more efficient and accurate.

Azure has a service called **Anomaly detector**. It detects anomalies in data to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues.

## Computer Vision AI
**Computer Vision** is when we use Machine Learning Neural Networks to **gain high level understanding from digital images or videos**.

Computer Vision Deep Learning Algorithms:
- **Convolutional neural network (CNN):** image and video recognition. Inspired after how human eyes actually process information and send it back to brain to be processed.
- **Recurrent neural network (RNN):** handwriting recognition or speech recognition. 

Types of Computer Vision:
- **Image Classification:** look at an image or video and classify (place it in a category)
- **Object Detection:** identify objects within an image or video and apply labels and location boundaries.
- **Semantic Segmentation:** identify segments or objects by drawing pixel mask (great for objects in movement)
- **Image Analysis:** analyze an image or a video to apply descriptive and context labels. e.g. An employee sitting at a Desk in Tokyo.
- **Optical Character Recognition:** Find text in images or videos and extract them into digital text for editing.
- **Facial Detection:** detect faces in a photo or video, draw a location boundary, label their expression.
