# ML and AI Concepts
## Layers of Machine Learning
### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Machines that perform jobs that **mimic human behaviour**.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Machines that get better at a task **without explicit programming**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
Machines that have an **artificial neural network** inspired by the human brain to solve complex problems.

### What is a Data Scientist?
A person with **multi-disciplinary skills** in math, statistics, predictive modeling, and machine learning **to make future predictions**.

## Key Elements of AI
AI is just the outcome. AI is the software that **imitates human behaviour and capabilities**.

Key elements:
- **Machine learning:** the foundation of AI system, learn and predict like a human
- **Anomaly detection:** detect outliers or things out of place like a human
- **Computer vision:** be able to see like a human
- **Natural language processing:** be able to process human languages and infer context
- **Conversational AI:** be able to hold a conversation with a human

## Data Sets
### What is a dataset?
A data set is a **logical grouping of units of data** that are closely related and/or share the same data structure.

There are **publicly available data** sets that are used in the **learning of statistics, data analytics, and machine learning**.

- **MNITS database:** Images of **handwritten digits** used to test classification, clustering, and image processing algorithm. 
- **Common Objects In Context (COCO) dataset:** A dataset which contains many common images using a JSON file (coco format) that identify objects or segments within an image. 

## Labeling
### What is Data Labeling?
The process of **identifying raw data** (images, text file, videos, etc.) **and adding one or more meaningful and informative labels** to **provide context** so that a machine learning model can learn.

With **supervised machine learning**, labeling is a prerequisite to produce training data and **each piece of data will generally be labeled by a human**.

With **unsupervised machine learning**, **labels will be produced by the machine**, and may not be human readable.

### What is a ground truth?
A properly labeled dataset that you can use as the objective standard to train and assess a given model is often called "ground truth". The accuracy of your trained model will depend on the accuracy of your ground truth.

## Supervised vs Unsupervised vs Reinforcement
**Supervised Learning (SL):** Data has been labeled for training. It is task-driven - **make a prediction**.
- When the labels are known and you want a precise outcome.
- When you need a specific value returned.
- e.g. **Classification**, **Regression**

**Unsuperfised Learning (UL)**: Data has not been labeled, the ML model needs to do its own labeling. It is data-driven - **recognize a structure or parttern**.
- When the labels are not known and the outcome does not need to be precise.
- When you're trying to make sense of data.
- e.g. **Clustering**, **Dimensionality Reduction**, **Association**

**Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: There is no data, there is an environment and an ML model generates data and makes many attempts to reach a goal. It is decisions-driven - **Game AI, Learning Tasks, Robot Navigation**

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
**Activation Functions** are algorithms applied to a hidden layer node that affects connected output. e.g. ReLu

**Dense** is when the next layer _increases_ the amount of nodes.

**Sparse** is when the next layer _decreases_ the amount of nodes.

### What are Neural Networks (NN)?
Often described as **mimicking the brain**, it is a **neuron/node represents an algorithm.**

Data is inputted into a neuron and based on the output the data will be passed to one of many other connected neurals. The connections between neurons is **weighted**. The network is organized in layers.
There will be an **input layer**, 1 to many **hidden layers** and an **output layer**.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
A neural network that has **3 or more hidden layers** is considered deep learning.

### What is Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)?
Neural Networks where connections between nodes do not form a cycle (always move forward)

### What is Backpropagation (BP)?
Moves backwards through the neural network adjusting weights to improve outcome on next iteration. This is how a neural network learns.

### Loss Function
A function that compares the _ground truth_ to the prediction to determine the error rate (how bad the network performed)

## Graphics processing unit (GPU)
### What is a GPU?
Designed to quickly render high-resolution images and video **concurrently**. It can perform **parallel operations on multiple sets of data**, 
and so they are commonly used for **non-graphical tasks such as machine learning** and scientific computation.

CPU can average 4 to 16 processor cores while a GPU can average **thousands of processor cores**. They are best suited for **repetetive** and **highly-parallel** computing tasks
such as _rendering graphics_, _Cryptocurrency mining_, and _Deep Learning and ML_.

## Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA)
### What is NVIDIA?
**NVIDIA** is a company that manufactures **GPUs** for gaming and professional markets.

### What is CUDA?
Compute Unified Device Architecture is a **parallel computing platform** and **API** by NVIDIA that allows developers to use **CUDA-enabled GPUs** for general-purpose computing on GPUs.

All major deep learning frameworks are integrated with **NVIDIA Deep Learning SDK**. It is a collection of NVIDIA libraries for deep learning.
One of those libraries is the **CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN)**. It provides highly tuned implementations for standard routines such as:
- forward and backward convolution
- Pooling
- Normalization
- activation layers

## Simple ML Pipeline
Data Labeling → Feature Engineering → Training → Hyperparameter Tuning → Serving → Inference (either Real-time Endpoint or Batch Processing)

## Forecast vs Prediction
### What is a Forecast?
Makes a future prediction with **relevant data**.
- Analysis of trends
- It's not "guessing"

### What is a Prediction?
Makes a future prediction **without relevant data**.
- Uses statistics to predict future outcomes
- It's more of "guessing
- Uses decision theory

## Evaluation Metrics
### Performance/Evaluation Metrics
Used to evaluate different Machine Learning Algorithms. For different types of problems different metrics matter.
- Classification Metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC, AUC)
- Regression Metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE)
- Ranking Metrics (MRR, DCG, NDCG)
- Statistical Metrics (Correlation)
- Computer Vision Metrics (PSNR, SSIM, IoU)
- NLP Metrics (Perplexity, BLEU, METEOR, ROGUE)
- Deep Learning Related Metrics (Inception Score, Frechet Inception distance)

There are two categories of evaluation metrics
- **Internal Evaluation:** metrics used to evaluate the internals of the ML model
  - Accuracy, F1 Score, Precision, Recall (The Famous Four) used in all kinds of model
- **External Evaluation:** metrics used to evaluate the final prediction of the ML model

## Jupyter Notebooks

## Regression (Supervised)
**Regression** is a process of finding a function to **correlate a labeled dataset into continous variable/number**. Outcome: Predict this _variable_ in the future.

"What will the temperature be next week?" e.g. 20c

Vector (dots) are plotted on a graph in multiple dimensions e.g. (X, Y). A regression line is drawn through the dataset. The _distance_ of the vector from the regression line is called an _Error_.

Different **Regression algorithms** use the error to predict future variables:
- Mean squared error (MSE)
- Root mean squared error (RMSE)
- Mean absolute error (MAE)

## Classification (Supervised)
**Classification** is a process of finding a function to **divide a labeled dataset into classes/categories**. Outcome: Predict _category_ to apply to the inputted data.

"Will it rain next Saturday?" e.g. Sunny, Rainy

A _classification line_ divides the dataset. **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Tree/Random Forest**, **Neural Network**, **Naive Bayes**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Support Vector Machines** are examples of _classification algorithms_.

## Clustering (Unsupervised)
**Clustering** is a process of **grouping unlabeled data based on similarities and differences**. Outcome: Group data based on similarities or differences. 

Recommend purchasing between a _Windows_ or a _MAC_ computer.

**K-means**, **K-medoids**, **Density Based**, and **Heirarchical** are examples of _clustering algorithms_.

## Confusion Matrix
**Confusion matrix** is a table to visualize the **model predictions** (predicted) vs **ground truth labels** (actual). It is also known as error matrix.
They are useful in classification problems.

Confusion Matrix creates a table that answers how many were **False Negatives**, **False Positives**, **True Negatives**, and **True Positives**.

## Anomaly Detection AI
### What is an anomaly?
An abnormal thing; a marked deviation from the norm or a standard.

### What is anomaly detection?

1. **Fairness:** AI systems should treat all people fairly
2. **Reliability and Safety:** AI systems should perform reliably and safely
3. **Privacy and Security:** AI systems should be secure and respect privacy
4. **Inclusiveness:** AI systems should empower everyone and engage people
5. **Transparency:** AI systems should be understandable
6. **Accountability:** People should be accountable for AI systems

## Fairness
**AI systems should treat all people fairly.**

AI systems can reinforce existing societal stereotypical. Bias can be introduced during the development of a pipeline.

**Azure ML can tell you how each feature can influence a model's prediction for bias.**

**Fairlearn** is an open-source python project to help data scientist to improve fairness in their AI systems.

## Reliability and Safety
**AI systems should perform reliably and safely**

AI software must be **rigorously tested** to ensure they work as expected before release to the end user.

If there are scenarios where AI is making mistakes its important to release a report **quantified risks and harm** to end-users so they are informed of the short-comings of an AI solution.

## Privacy and Security
**AI systems should be secure and respect privacy**

AI can require vasts amounts of data to train Deep Learning ML models. The nature of the ML model may require **Personally identifiable information (PII)**.

It is important that we ensure protection of user data that it is not leaked or disclosed.

## Inclusiveness
**AI systems should empower everyone and engage people**

If we can design AI solutions for the **minority** of users, then we can design AI solutions for the majority of users.

Minority Groups:
- Physical ability
- Gender
- Sexual Orientation
- Ethnicity
- Other factors

## Transparency
**AI systems should be understandable**

Interpretability/Intelligibility is when end-users can understand the behaviour of the UI.

Transparency of AI systems can result in:
- Mitigating unfairness
- Help developers debug their AI systems
- Gaining more trust from our users

## Accountability
**People should be accountable for AI systems**

The structure put in place to consistently enacting AI principles and taking them into account.

AI systems should work within:
- Framework and Governance
- Organizational Principles
- Ethical and Legal Standards that are clearly defined
