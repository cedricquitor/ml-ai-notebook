# This repository serves as my notebook in learning Data Science.

In this learning process, I'll follow [Tina Huang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww)'s process of learning just enough, doing a project, and iterating it.

**In self studying, it is important to hold yourself accountable.**

These are the resources that I am following:
- I am following this GeekForGeeks' [How to Become Data Scientist â€“ A Complete Roadmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-become-data-scientist-a-complete-roadmap/).

# Introduction
**What is Machine Learning?**
Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

The harder things become to describe, the harder it is for us to tell machines what to do. Things that only humans can do and computers couldn't do before can now be done with Machine Learning. It makes machines act more and more like humans.

The process of training a Machine Learning Model is to feed inputs, train the machine to learn based on the input that we fed, so that it gives us an output the next time we feed a new input.
