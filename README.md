# This repository serves as my notebook in learning Data Science.

In this learning process, I'll follow [Tina Huang](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2UXDak6o7rBm23k3Vv5dww)'s process of learning just enough, doing a project, and iterating it.

**In self studying, it is important to hold yourself accountable.**

These are the resources that I am following:
- I am following this GeekForGeeks' [How to Become Data Scientist â€“ A Complete Roadmap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-become-data-scientist-a-complete-roadmap/).
